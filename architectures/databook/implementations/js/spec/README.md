## Source

These DataBooks were produced during design sessions in April 2026 and are stored in GDrive under `Chloe-Kurt Sessions/DataBooks/`. Download from there if not present locally.

## Format note

These spec DataBooks use the `<script language="application/yaml">` frontmatter form (canonical in DataBook v1.0; accepted alternative in v1.1). They are valid and parseable by all DataBook-aware tools.
