# DataBook CLI — Cross-Cutting Conventions v1.0

This document defines conventions that apply uniformly across all DataBook CLI
commands. Individual command specs reference this document by section rather
than restating these conventions. Where a command deviates from a convention,
the deviation is explicitly noted in that command's spec.
